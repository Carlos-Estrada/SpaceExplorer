The Space Explorer is a mobile game where the player controls a spaceship, navigates through space, avoids obstacles, and collects stars for points. The game increases in difficulty as the player progresses. The project includes a backend built using Go for handling game data and player scores, and a frontend built using React Native for providing the game interface on mobile devices.
